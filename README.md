# PLC-Projects
Few starter PLC programs, just to demonstrate my level of comfort and proficiency using the following software programs:

* EPLAN P8 for Electrical Wiring.

* CodeSys both in Ladder Diagram Programming and in Structured Text Programming.

* TwinCat3 in Structred Text Programing.

Please feel free to check the two provided pdf files for a quick overview of the projects. I have also provided the all the project files inside the .rar file.
